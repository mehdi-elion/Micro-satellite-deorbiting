# Micro-satellite-deorbiting
This repository shows the results obtained from a micro-satellite deorbiting simulation I did during my internship within the Space Robotics Lab of Tohoku University, Sendai (Japan). During this internship, I proposed a first 'prototype' model of the micro-satellite with its deployed SDOM (separable de-orbiting module) whose first simulation showed some promising results. <br>

Here is an animation showing an example result obtained from that model :

This repository also contains the internship report and a slideshow.
